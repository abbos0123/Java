# Java 8 in Action 

Every new version of Java is important, but Java 8 is a game changer. Java 8 in Action is a clearly written guide to the new features of Java 8. It begins with a practical introduction to lambdas, using real-world Java code. Next, it covers the new Streams API and shows how you can use it to make collection-based code radically easier to understand and maintain. It also explains other major Java 8 features including default methods, Optional, CompletableFuture, and the new Date and Time API.
