# HEAD FIRST JAVA 📖
Many people will think that this is dated book, but to be honest Head First Java is the best book for any programmer who is new in both programming and Java. The head-first way of explanation is quite phenomenal and I really enjoyed their book.

Head First Java covers the essential Java programming knowledge about class, object, thread, collection, and language features, like Generics, Enums, variable arguments, or auto-boxing.

They also have some advanced section on Swing, networking, and Java IO, which makes them a complete package for Java beginners. This should be your first Java book you look at if you’re starting from scratch.
