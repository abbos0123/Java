# Java Threads :coffee: :arrows_counterclockwise:

Threads are essential to Java programming, but learning to use them effectively is a nontrivial task. 
This new edition of the classic Java Threads shows you how to take full advantage of Java's threading facilities 
and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a 
thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.Java's threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. 
In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems 
were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make 
the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.You'll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how 
to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and 
starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.Java Threads, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded 
and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, 
using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted).
